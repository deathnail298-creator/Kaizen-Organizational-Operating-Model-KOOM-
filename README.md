# KOOM — Kaizen Organizational Operating Module

**Phase 0 Reference Skeleton**
*(NASA-class, mission-critical, AI + human systems)*

---

## Note for Executives and Managers

KOOM works best when paired with training using the **Kaizen AI Integration Module**. KOOM will still produce positive results on its own; however, results are consistently amplified when supported by Kaizen training.

---

## Overview

**KOOM is not a plug-and-play operating model for typical organizations.**

It is a deliberate, load-bearing **operating spine** designed for environments that cannot tolerate role drift, undocumented workflows, uncontrolled AI usage, or ambiguous authority.

Typical applicability includes (non-exhaustive):

* Space and aerospace mission operations
* Defense and national-security programs
* Safety-critical infrastructure
* Regulated, compliance-heavy organizations
* AI-augmented operations with real failure consequences

KOOM is intended to be **forked, extended, and contextualized**. Version 1.0 is intentionally rigid so nothing can be bolted on ambiguously. All adaptation, relaxation, and domain-specific elaboration belongs to your **Center of Excellence (CoE)** in Phase 1 and beyond.

---

## What KOOM Defines

KOOM explicitly defines:

* How work flows
* How roles interact
* How decisions move
* How AI is safely integrated
* How alignment is maintained
* How systems evolve
* How drift is prevented

It is designed to be:

* Easy to graft onto any org chart
* Readable by executives
* Usable by managers
* Practical for workers
* Enforceable by a Center of Excellence
* Safe for AI adoption
* Stable under real-world conditions

KOOM **does not require reorganization**. It overlays onto existing structures without changing reporting lines or departments.

---

## Why KOOM Exists

Most organizations operate in a constant state of:

* Priority whiplash
* Unclear roles
* Improvised workflows
* Uncontrolled AI usage
* Undocumented steps
* Inconsistent quality
* Ambiguous communication
* Drift between teams
* Continuous firefighting

KOOM replaces this with a **clean, unambiguous operating constitution**.

Executives direct.
Managers interpret.
Workers execute.
CoE designs structure.
Audit verifies truth.
Governance enforces boundaries.
AI accelerates without destabilizing.

## The KOOM Spine

KOOM is built on four strictly separated layers:

* **Executive Layer** — strategy, constraints, priorities
* **Manager Layer** — interpretation into executable work
* **Worker Layer** — precise execution under documented workflows
* **Center of Excellence (CoE)** — workflow design, standards, AI rules

And two stabilizers:

* **Governance** — prevents drift
* **Audit** — ensures reality matches documentation

Plus two organizational rhythms:

* **Alignment Cycle** — short-term synchronization
* **Evolution Cycle** — structured long-term improvement

This separation is the core of KOOM.

---

## Included Modules

Each module is self-contained and upload-ready:

* Worker Layer
* Manager Layer
* Executive Layer
* Center of Excellence (CoE)
* Task Flow Map
* AI Integration Layer
* Metrics & Scorecards
* Governance & Audit
* Alignment & Evolution
* Deployment Readiness

---

## Who KOOM Is For

**Executives** — clarity without micromanagement
**Managers** — rules, escalation paths, and stability
**CoE / Ops / Quality Teams** — formal authority over structure
**Workers** — clear instructions and AI-safe boundaries
**AI / Automation Teams** — scalable AI without chaos
**Consultants / Analysts / Org-Design Engineers** — a complete, modular operating spine

---

## What KOOM Is Not

* Not a reorganization
* Not a theory paper
* Not a management fad
* Not a consulting package
* Not a buzzword stack
* Not a "future of work" gimmick

KOOM is a **practical operating model** that organizations can deploy immediately.

---

## Deployment Model (Typical)

1. Train Executives
2. Train Managers
3. Activate CoE workflows
4. Run a pilot team
5. Scale after verified improvement

Deployment Readiness includes full checklists, green flags, and red flags.

## Commercialization & Licensing

### Non-Commercial Use (No License Required)

KOOM may be **used, modified, and deployed internally** for non-commercial purposes, including:

* Internal evaluation or pilots
* Internal operations improvement
* Internal governance or restructuring
* Internal employee training
* Academic or research use
* Non-profit or unpaid educational use

No notification or permission is required for these uses.

---

### What Counts as Commercialization

A commercialization license is required if KOOM is used in any of the following ways (non-exhaustive):

* Incorporated into **paid products, platforms, or software**
* Used in **client-facing services or deliverables**
* Referenced in **sales materials, bids, proposals, or marketing**
* Used as the basis for **paid training, certification, or workshops**
* Embedded in **consulting, advisory, or transformation engagements**
* Packaged into **methods, templates, or tooling sold to third parties**

If KOOM contributes to external value generation or revenue, it is considered commercial use.

---

### Commercialization License

* **Type:** One-time commercialization license
* **Current standard list price:** **$50,000 USD**
* **Royalties:** None
