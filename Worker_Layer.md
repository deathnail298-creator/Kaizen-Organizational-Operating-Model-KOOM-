Kaizen Organizational Operating Module (KOOM)
Worker Layer – v1.0
1. Purpose of the Worker Layer

The Worker Layer executes the work.
They do not design workflows.
They do not define standards.
They do not determine priorities.

Their purpose is simple:

Execute the assigned tasks with clarity, consistency, and accuracy — using the tools, workflows, and standards provided.

Workers are the sensory and execution systems of the organization.
KOOM protects them from scope creep and “figure it out” culture.

2. What the Worker Layer Owns

Workers are responsible for:

Completing tasks assigned by Managers

Following documented procedures

Using approved tools and AI systems as trained

Reporting blockers, errors, or unexpected conditions

Providing accurate ground-truth data

Maintaining personal workload visibility (what’s done, what’s pending)

Requesting clarification when instructions are unclear

That’s the entire ownership set.
No hidden responsibilities.
No “implied” expectations.

3. What the Worker Layer Does Not Own

Workers do not:

Create or change processes

Decide priorities

Redesign tools

Choose which metrics matter

Interpret executive strategy

Define standards

Approve or modify workflows

“Hack together” a way to make something work

Build training or quality criteria

Escalate outside the defined chain

These prohibitions exist to keep the organization sane.

Ambiguity here breaks everything above it.

4. Worker → Manager Interaction Rules
Rule 1 — Workers surface facts, not solutions.

Managers translate facts into decisions.

Rule 2 — Workers request clarity early.

If a task is unclear, the Worker must ask for clarification rather than guessing.

Rule 3 — Workers escalate blockers immediately.

Unreported blockers cascade into systemic failure.

Rule 4 — Workers respect scope boundaries.

Doing more than assigned, or reinterpreting tasks, creates chaos.

Rule 5 — Workers document reality as it is, not as it “should” be.

Accurate reporting enables real management.

5. Worker Layer AI Usage Rules

KOOM allows Worker-level AI usage only within a defined sandbox:

Workers may use AI to:

Summarize content they already understand

Draft initial versions of routine outputs

Generate checklists or step-by-step expansions of instructions

Transform information formats (notes → outline, etc.)

Review instructions for clarity

Workers must not use AI to:

Invent or guess missing procedures

Answer questions outside their skill domain

Modify official standards

Produce output that bypasses Manager review

Replace documented workflows

Make decisions that belong to higher layers

The Worker Layer gets speed, not authority.

6. Performance Expectations

The Worker Layer is evaluated on:

Accuracy — Did they follow the instructions correctly?

Throughput — How consistently do they complete tasks?

Communication — Did they escalate blockers promptly?

Reliability — Do they deliver predictable, stable output?

Standards Compliance — Did they follow procedures as written?

Workers are not judged on:

creativity

strategic thinking

managerial interpretation

systems design

organizational improvement proposals

Those belong to other layers.

7. The KOOM Promise to Workers

KOOM guarantees:

No worker is expected to produce expert-level output.
Expertise lives in CoE and management, not at the execution layer.

Tasks will be well-defined before they reach the Worker Layer.
Workers execute — they don’t guess.

AI will never replace management responsibilities with “automated requests.”
Managers remain accountable for instructions.

Workers never suffer from “make it up as you go.”
The spine eliminates undocumented chaos.

Workers get clarity, consistency, and protection from scope creep.

When the Worker Layer functions cleanly, the entire organization gains stability.

8. Raccoons Inc. Worker Example

In the Raccoons Incorporated demonstration model:

Workers perform tasks using standardized toolkits

Blockers are escalated instantly

No Worker modifies workflows

AI is used strictly for speed and formatting, not for decisions

Ground-truth reporting feeds Manager and CoE layers

Workload visibility prevents bottlenecks and “surprise” delays

It’s a simple, efficient, repeatable execution layer.
