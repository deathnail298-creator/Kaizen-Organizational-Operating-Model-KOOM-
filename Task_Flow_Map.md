Kaizen Organizational Operating Module (KOOM)
Task Flow Map – v1.0
1. Purpose of the Task Flow Map

The Task Flow Map is the operational bloodstream of KOOM.

Every piece of work — no matter the task, department, or complexity — must move through this same universal pathway.

Why?

Because inconsistent paths create:

confusion

duplicated work

invisible blockers

role violations

missed handoffs

ungoverned AI usage

unpredictable quality

and ultimately, organizational collapse

The Task Flow Map prevents that by giving the organization one unified workflow model, end to end.

2. The Universal KOOM Pathway

Every task flows through the same stages:

1. Executive → Direction

Executives define goals, constraints, and priorities.
They do not define tasks or methods.

2. Manager → Interpretation

Managers transform executive direction into:

structured work packages

clear instructions

quality expectations

deadlines

scope boundaries

Managers never bypass this step.

3. Worker → Execution

Workers perform the assigned tasks using:

the approved workflow

the approved tools

the training defined by CoE

Workers do not guess or invent missing procedures.

4. Manager → Validation

Managers review outputs for:

accuracy

completeness

compliance with standards

blockers or variance

Managers do not rubber-stamp work.

5. CoE → Structural Review (as needed)

If patterns of issues appear:

training gaps

tool friction

workflow flaws

repeated rework

quality inconsistencies

the Manager escalates to the CoE.

CoE examines the system, not the individual.

6. Executive → Adjustment (if needed)

Execs update direction only when:

constraints change

resources move

strategic priorities shift

This cycle restarts.

Think of this as KOOM’s circulatory system — always flowing, always clean, always predictable.

4. Acceptable Task Types
A. Routine Tasks

Normal work that fits within existing workflows.
Follow the path exactly.

B. Novel Tasks

Never-before-seen work.
These must trigger:

Manager interpretation

CoE involvement

Workflow creation

Training update

Novel tasks are not allowed to bypass structure.

C. Emergency Tasks

Urgent issues requiring fast action.
Even then, they must:

enter through managers

be logged

be reviewed after completion

KOOM does not permit “cowboy work.”

5. Escalation Triggers

A task must be escalated upward when:

worker instructions are unclear

priority conflicts appear

tools fail or create friction

quality expectations cannot be met

constraints are impossible

unsafe AI usage risks emerge

roles are blurred

blockers last more than one cycle

task complexity exceeds worker skill

information required is missing

Escalation is mandatory — not optional.

A non-escalated blocker is a silent organizational failure.

6. Handoff Rules
Rule 1 — No skipping layers

Exec → Worker is forbidden.
CoE → Worker is forbidden.
Worker → Exec is forbidden.

Rule 2 — Every handoff requires clarity

Before you hand a task downward or upward, ask:

“Could this be misunderstood?”

If the answer is “yes,” it must be clarified.

Rule 3 — No undocumented steps

Every transformation or action must match:

the workflow

the template

the checklist

the SOP

If something doesn’t exist yet, the CoE creates it — workers and managers do not.

Rule 4 — Managers own the bandwidth limits

If workers are overloaded, managers re-sequence tasks.
Executives don’t micromanage; workers don’t burn out.

7. AI Integration Within the Task Flow

AI is allowed only in layer-appropriate ways.

Worker AI Use

summarize

expand

reformat

assist

Workers never make AI-driven decisions.

Manager AI Use

convert executive goals into structured task lists

analyze workload

draft communications

produce summaries

Managers do not use AI to bypass CoE or create unapproved workflows.

Executive AI Use

drafting

summarizing

scenario analysis

option comparison

Executives do not use AI to create instructions or workflows.

CoE AI Use

developing standards

evaluating consistency

testing workflows

scenario simulation

tooling evaluation

CoE AI usage is the most flexible, but still bounded by policy.

8. Completion → Feedback Loop

A task is not complete until the loop finishes:

Worker executes

Manager validates

Issues surface

CoE collects patterns

Executives adjust constraints if needed

This loop is how KOOM remains alive and self-correcting.

9. Raccoons Inc. Example

A simple example from the fictional Raccoons Incorporated model:

Executive: “Reduce packing errors by 10%.”

Manager: Creates discrete tasks, trains workers on existing workflows, sets QC checkpoints.

Workers: Execute using scanner and checklist SOP.

Manager: Notices repeated mis-scans from the east wing.

CoE: Investigates → finds ambient lighting causing sensor errors → updates SOP + scanner settings.

Manager deploys the update.

Workers execute the improved workflow.

Errors drop by 12%.

This is KOOM in motion.
Simple. Predictable. Scalable.
