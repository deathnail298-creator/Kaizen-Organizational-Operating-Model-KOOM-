Kaizen Organizational Operating Module (KOOM)
AI Integration Layer – v1.0
1. Purpose of the AI Integration Layer

AI accelerates work.
AI amplifies capability.
AI does not replace structure, expertise, or decision authority.

The AI Integration Layer defines:

what AI is allowed to do

what AI is forbidden from doing

which layer controls which AI actions

safety, review, and escalation rules

failure modes and containment boundaries

This prevents:

AI hallucinated procedures

unauthorized decision-making

workers using AI to bypass managers

managers using AI to bypass CoE

executives using AI to bypass managers and workers

the “everything is AI now” collapse

KOOM is built around a simple truth:

AI is a tool, not a substitute for organizational roles.
2. AI Permissions by Layer (Hard Boundaries)

Each layer has specific, non-overlapping AI capabilities.

Worker Layer — AI Sandbox (Strict Limits)

Workers may use AI for:

summarizing existing information

reformatting content (list → paragraph, paragraph → bullet points)

extracting steps from instructions

clarifying definitions

generating simple checklists

rewriting unclear instructions into clearer language

Workers may NOT use AI for:

creating procedures

designing workflows

making decisions

producing expert-level output

answering domain-expert questions

bypassing manager validation

interpreting strategic direction

altering templates or SOPs

inventing missing information

Workers get speed, not authority.

Manager Layer — AI Expansion (Moderate Flex)

Managers may use AI for:

converting executive goals into structured tasks

analyzing workload distribution

summarizing blockers or team patterns

drafting communication, briefs, or schedules

refining instructions for workers

performing basic data organization and triage

Managers may NOT use AI for:

creating or modifying workflows (CoE job)

producing standards, templates, or SOPs

generating expert-level technical decisions

making executive-level resource choices

bypassing validation

changing metrics or quality thresholds

Managers get clarity and throughput, not system design.

Executive Layer — AI Strategy Support (Controlled Use)

Executives may use AI for:

scenario analysis within their domain

summarizing reports and metrics

drafting strategic communications

modeling high-level constraints

comparing possible directions

expanding rough ideas into structured formats

Executives may NOT use AI for:

task creation (Manager job)

workflow creation (CoE job)

issuing instructions directly to workers

bypassing the organizational spine

pretending to be experts in technical areas

overriding process based on AI output

creating standards

Executives get speed in thinking, not speed in meddling.

Center of Excellence (CoE) — AI Structural Use (Highest Level)

The CoE may use AI for:

designing workflows

testing SOPs for clarity

stress-testing processes

analyzing quality variance

generating structured templates

simulating operational scenarios

reviewing standards for consistency

drafting training modules

validating process logic

The CoE may NOT use AI for:

making executive-level strategic decisions

assigning or managing work

evaluating individual worker performance

bypassing required stakeholder review

deploying changes without communication cycles

CoE gets system-level enhancement, not dictatorship.

3. AI Escalation Rules

If AI reveals:

missing procedures

unclear instructions

conflicting standards

gaps in workflows

technical unknowns

unsafe outputs

hallucinated steps

domain ambiguity

the user must escalate to the appropriate layer:

Workers → Managers

Managers → CoE

CoE → Executives (only if constraints need adjusting)

You never guess.
You never “just figure it out.”

KOOM prohibits AI-driven improvisation.

4. AI Safety Boundaries

These boundaries apply globally across all layers:

Boundary 1 — AI Cannot Create Unapproved Workflows

Only the CoE has that authority.

Boundary 2 — AI Cannot Make Decisions Assigned to Humans

AI does not choose priorities, success criteria, or resource allocation.

Boundary 3 — AI Output Requires Human Validation

No exceptions.

Boundary 4 — AI Cannot Replace Skill

It can accelerate a skill, but not substitute for the underlying expertise.

Boundary 5 — AI Cannot Introduce Undocumented Steps

If AI generates something not in the SOP, it must be escalated.

Boundary 6 — AI Cannot Flatten the Organizational Spine

No skipping layers.

Boundary 7 — AI Cannot Remove Accountability

Human decisions remain human decisions.

These boundaries prevent organizational collapse.

5. Failure Modes From Improper AI Use

Improper AI usage causes predictable structural failures.

Failure Mode 1 — Worker Overreach

AI makes workers feel like they can make expert decisions.

→ Result: Hidden errors, bad assumptions, inconsistent quality.

Failure Mode 2 — Manager Shortcutting

Managers use AI to invent workflows instead of escalating to CoE.

→ Result: Fragmentation and divergence.

Failure Mode 3 — Executive Bypass

Executives use AI to generate tasks or processes and skip the chain.

→ Result: Manager disempowerment and chaos downstream.

Failure Mode 4 — CoE Autocracy

CoE overuses AI to create workflows without proper field feedback.

→ Result: Standards become divorced from reality.

KOOM prevents all four through strict boundary enforcement.

6. Raccoons Inc. Example

In the Raccoons Incorporated demonstration model:

Workers use AI to summarize packing checklists and reformat instructions

Managers use AI to generate daily workload planning

Executives use AI to model scenarios but never issue direct worker instructions

CoE uses AI to test new scanner workflows before release

The AI Integration Layer ensures that tools accelerate the right things —
and never the wrong ones.
